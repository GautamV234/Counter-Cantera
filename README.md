## Objective

The objective of this project is to create an efficient and reliable interpolation system that can accurately estimate chemical properties and thermodynamic parameters using a limited number of data points. By leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques, we have developed a custom software that mimics the functionality of Cantera while operating within the constraints of limited data availability.

## Features

- Interpolation of chemical properties: LimitedDataCantera enables the interpolation of various chemical properties such as pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, and more.
- Limited data utilization: Our software has been designed to effectively interpolate and estimate properties even when the available data points are limited, enabling broader applicability and versatility.
- Robust algorithms: We have implemented advanced algorithms to ensure accurate interpolation results and maintain computational efficiency.
- User-friendly interface: LimitedDataCantera features a user-friendly interface, making it intuitive and easy to use for researchers, engineers, and scientists working in the field of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics.

## Usage

To use CounterCantera, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries as specified in the documentation.
3. Import the LimitedDataCantera module into your Matlab project.
